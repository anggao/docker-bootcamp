docker run -d -P -v ${PWD}:/var/www/html bootcamp:webserver

### Note:
+ when a container is in a paused state you can still login to it:
  `docker exec -it web2 /bin/bash`

### Linking containers
+ Links allow containers to discover each other and securely transfer information about one container to another.
+ A source container and a recipient container
+ --link option
+ Docker relies on the names of your containers
